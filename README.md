# HackScripts?

## What is HackScripts?

HackScripts is a collection of scripts that I use to automate the setup of my servers and development environments. The scripts are written in bash and are tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

## How to use HackScripts?

To use HackScripts, you can clone the repository and run the scripts that you need. The scripts are organized into folders based on their purpose. The `setup` folder contains scripts that set up the development environment, the `server` folder contains scripts that set up the server environment, and the `security` folder contains scripts that set up security features.
